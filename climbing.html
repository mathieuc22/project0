      Even if I would love to do some traditional climbing and spend lots of time outdoor... practicing rock climbing in a big city is quite difficult and indoor climbing is almost the only alternative.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
      But don't get me wrong, sport climbing is a lot of fun even indoor. It's very challenging, you can work on strengh and flexibility, and you can go whenever you want no matter the weather.

      After renting my gear at the gym for a while, I now have my own:

        <td>Petzl Reverso</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Climbing harness</th>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Climbing shoe</th>
