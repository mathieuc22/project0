      Even if I would love to do some traditional climbing and spend lots of time outdoor... practicing rock climbing in a big city is quite difficult and indoor climbing is almost the only alternative.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
      But don't get me wrong, sport climbing is a lot of fun even indoor. It's very challenging, you can work on strengh and flexibility, and you can go whenever you want no matter the weather.

    <h2>My climbing gear</h2>
    <p class="text-justify">
      After renting my gear at the gym for a while, I now have my own:

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Belay device</th>
        <td>Petzl Reverso</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Climbing harness</th>
        <td>Black Diamond Solution</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Climbing shoe</th>
        <td>Red Chili Circuit Lace</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
